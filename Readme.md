|:-----------------------|:--------------:|:-----------------------|:--------------:|
| model | global | 95% (139/145)          | 90% (611/676) |

## Running

Open a terminal and go to the project target directory (which has to be previously built with maven). Once there, execute this command:

```
java --enable-preview -jar AM31-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
You'll have to choose if you want to launch server, CLI client or GUI client by typing the option number on your keyboard.

In order to play, you'll have to launch at least one server and two clients (either CLI or GUI).
